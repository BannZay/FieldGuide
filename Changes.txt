Many bug fixes, new profession functionality, refactoring.

- Now able to show all professions including trainer-taught skills as well as recipes, formulas etc.
- Minor, minor UI adjustments.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed bug where Hunter pet skills and Warlock demon spells do not show as learned.
- The Mail and Plate skills will now show as learned once they have been learned.
- Rogue poisons will now show as learned once they have been learned.
- Dire Bear Form used to show Bear Form as learnable again (due to the player technically unlearning Bear Form). This has now been fixed.
- Fixed a bug where certain classes' spells did not show up.
