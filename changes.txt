Updated readme, refactoring, added Priest and Shaman abilities

- Updated readme.
- Major refactoring: instead of checking a bunch of conditions on all frames every time player scrolls, it now checks for all these conditions only when toggling a checkbox and on addon load. Now it only checks for one condition every frame.
- Added Priest and Shaman abilities, however due to horizontal scroll not working yet errors will happen.
- Other, smaller non-functional changes.
- Weapon skills still do not work properly (will fix later) â€“ Warriors will also by default have horizontal value of 14 since they can learn all weapon skills (all 14 of them).
